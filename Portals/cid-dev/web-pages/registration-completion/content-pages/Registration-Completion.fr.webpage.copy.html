      The testing of the Company registration is complete. Had this been a real registration, then you would now be presented with 
      the CID Data Platform in-year landing page. The date you registered becomes your Anniversary Date and your company's annual update 
      would be required annually on the anniversary date. A sample email confirming the completion of your test registration has also been sent. 
      If you would like to restart the Registration process then, please email the request to TC.CIDTesting-BDICEssai.TC@tc.gc.ca and we will 
      email you back when the process is complete, so that you may begin.
